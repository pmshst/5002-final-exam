41,Twila Brase president president and co-founder of the Minnesota-based ,1
42,What we’re really talking about here is the possibility of making babies ,1
43,We don’t know how this will go,1
44,Brase added that people and news outlets are trying to figure out to what extent is this true and how does the scientist actually define ,1
45,What did he actually do,1

47,there will be people and special interest groups that say CRISPR could and should be used more to genetically edit babies ,1
48,We aren’t God and we don’t know the unintended consequences of messing as it were the DNA of a human,1
49,It’s really important to look at the future and wonder what it would mean for people who chose not to be edited,1
50,a pro-life law firm and advocacy group is not pleased with the idea,1
51,It's an enormous threat,1
52,This is far too premature,1
53,used a gene-editing technique known as CRISPR to alter the DNA of two children in a petri dish ,1
54,the American researchers killed theirs,1
55,The prospect of genetically eliminating crippling diseases is certainly appealing,1
56,there is a difference between genetic engineering and the extremely promising field of gene therapy,1
57,Playing with humanity's genetic code could open a Pandora's box,1
58,Scientists will eventually be able to alter DNA not just to protect against disease but also to create genetically enhanced human beings,1
59,Only the wealthy would be able to afford made-to-order babies,1
60,This means the privileged few would be able to eliminate imperfections and improve the talent,1
61,locking in their privilege for generations,1

63,This could be a death blow to the American Dream,1
64,the idea that anyone who is willing to work hard in this country can rise up the economic ladder,1
65,genetic engineering could actually eliminate opportunities for those at the bottom,1
66,one path to higher education for those at the bottom is scholarships for athletic or artistic talents,1
67,those scholarships will disappear for the unenhanced poor,1
68,with them the opportunities to improve their economic prospects in life,1
69,over time society will begin develop an intolerance for imperfection,1
70,if your children have an illness because you didn't genetically eliminate it,1
71,if they can't keep up because of their unenhanced cognitive abilities,1
72,makes them an unjust burden on the rest of us,1
73,we are separated into the enhanced and unenhanced,1
74,respect for the dignity of every human life will be diminished,1
75,If we don't make it in life because we are unenhanced,1
76,we don't get the credit,1
77,It is one thing to hit seventy home runs as the result of disciplined training and effort,1
78,Then there is the threat to women's equality,1

86,we have crossed a moral line from which there may be no return,1
87,What is it and should we worry,1
88, the excitement surrounding gene editing,1
89,is its potential to save people who would otherwise likely inherit a terminal or debilitating illness,1
