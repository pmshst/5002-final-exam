45,more likely to endorse genetic explanations for class & race differences in predictors of economic success,1
46,CRISPR is an acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats,1
47,This is the immune system that bacteria developed to protect themselves from infections by bacteriophages — the most abundant life form on the planet,1
48,Smaller than any known life form,1
49, proposed that an antimicrobe smaller than any known life form had killed the bacteria in infected patients,1
50, The bacteriophage has been studied intensely,1
51, The discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 has made gene editing very easy,1
52, Unfortunately the molecular tool has recently been found to be less precise than previously assumed, 0
53, It can lead to unwanted mutations in a cell's DNA,0
54, Researchers at Delft University of Technology have now identified a mechanism that causes such mutations when CRISPR-Cas9 is used incorrectly, 0
55, This can cause dormant genes to become expressed which is potentially very dangerous,0
56, The researchers have created a checklist based on their findings,1
57, Using this checklist will prevent the harmful mechanism from being activated and makes gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 safer, 1
58, human cells contain two copies of each chromosome: one from each parent,1
59,  These chromosome copies are almost identical,1
60,  they contain small differences in a number of genes,1
61, The small variations lead to the genetic differences between individuals,1
62, Having a backup for every chromosome may sound like a good thing,1
63, researchers of Delft University of Technology have found that it can cause problems in combination with the gene editing tool CRISPR-Cas9,0
64, When CRISPR-Cas9 is used to target a single chromosome in heterozygous organisms such as humans a natural repair mechanism is activated,1
65, It turns out that this mechanism uses the other copy of the chromosome as a template for repairing its DNA,1
66, gene editing experts using CRISPR-Cas9 can change part of the genome of a cell by introducing a new sequence of DNA,1
67, The Cas protein cuts open the DNA at a targeted spot,1
68, after which the cell is expected to repair its DNA using this new string of genetic material,1
69, new genes can be introduced,1
70, when the repair mechanism uses the other chromosome as a template instead of the newly introduced string of DNA,1
71, he editing will not be successful,0
72, Since repair using the other chromosome is far more efficient,1
73, repair using the intended DNA fragment almost never occurs,0
74, Diseased genes that were dormant may become expressed for instance genes that can cause cancer,0
75, This discovery of the repair mechanism that blocks gene editing was accidental,1
76, While this newly discovered mechanism can prevent gene editing from being successful ,1
77, can even lead to harmful mutations,0
78, repair mechanism only becomes active if just one chromosome is targeted for editing and not both,0
79, There are some other factors that need to be taken into account,0
80, Gene therapy is an emerging strategy to treat diseases caused by genetic abnormalities,1
81, One form of gene therapy involves the direct repair of a defective gene,1
82, using genome-editing technology such as CRISPR-Cas9,1
83, Despite its therapeutic potential,0
84, genome editing can also introduce unwanted and potentially harmful genetic errors that limit its clinical feasibility,0
85, researchers centered at Osaka University report the use of a modified version of CRISPR-Cas9 that can edit genes with substantially fewer errors,1
86, CRISPR-Cas9 works through the combined action of the Cas9 protein, 1
87, these two molecules allow virtually any gene in the genome to be targeted for editing,1
88, these two molecules allow virtually any gene in the genome to be targeted for editing,1
89, Cells have a precise form of repair that uses donor DNA as a template to correct damage,0
90, The problem is that Cas9 cleavage is rarely repaired by the precise route,0
91, essentially commandeer precise repair to make exact changes to the target gene,1
92, Our study is a proof of principle that target-donor nicking can achieve accurate genome editing without DNA cleavage,1
93, discovered information about a gene that sets primates,1
94, this gene can be thought of as one of the genetic factors that make us human in a neurological sense,1
95, genes have been hard to find but using an approach where we studied children with a certain brain malformation called periventricular nodular heterotopia,1
96, a subset of neurons in the developing brain fail to take up their correct position,1
97, set forth to test the point that the gene drives aspects of brain development that are unique to primates,1
98, Watch if you want to learn about risks and chances of CRISPR amidst the controversy of genetically edited embryos,0
99, The technology is really not ready to be deployed,0
