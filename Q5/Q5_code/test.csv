0,Unfortunately the molecular tool has recently been found to be less precise 
1,is potentially very dangerous
2, lead to unwanted mutations in a cell
3,editing may not be successful
4,The easiest way to understand the quagmire of privacy issues surrounding DNA is through the story of a serial killer in California
5,The advent of direct-to-consumer DNA sequencing changed the game
6,But DeAngelo never took a DNA test himself
7,The relatives who submitted their DNA to a database likely never dreamed it would be used to identify one of their family members by name 
8,multiple studies have found that it's possible to use DNA databases to identify people who have never taken a DNA test
9,One of the most exciting areas of biomedical science today is in genetic medicine
10,we are just now seeing the public investment into sequencing the human genome bear fruit in the form of treatments to help patients overcome hereditary disorders
11,The award is different than most prizes for medical achievements
12, A Chinese scientist claims he helped create genetically-edited twins who are resistant to HIV
13, it has everyone on the internat talking
14, But is it a promising step to stop diseases or a disturbing use of genetic technology
15, He Jiankui said he is "proud" of his work
16,using a tool known as CRISPR to remove a gene from the embryos of twin girls
17,altering their DNA to make them resistant to HIV
18,trial is a violation of international agreements and ethical norms
19,All parents want their children to be healthy
20,This could prevent devastating disease possibly
21,We don't know because it's still in early stages
22,Texas Professor’s Involvement In Chinese Genetic Editing Investigated
23,dviser at Rice for more than three years and published three papers with He
24,was asked whether there are other pregnancies with genome editing as part of his clinical trials
25,An independent expert questioned whether He’s claims could be a hoax
26,He’s gene editing research has yet to be vetted by experts or published in any scientific journal
27,claimed that he produced the world’s first genetically-edited babies
28,to alter the genes of a pair of twins while they were embryos to make the babies resistant to HIV
29,a possible second pregnancy had resulted from his project
30,announcements prompted mostly criticism from other experts in the field
31,Using CRISPR to make changes to embryos and germline cells—sperm
32,a US science and medicine advisory group decided to support research using technologies such as CRISPR to modify human embryos
33,CRISPR has been used to repair a mutation that causes blindness and correct the defect responsible for cystic fibrosis
34,CRISPR-Cas9 is a rudimentary immune system first noticed in bacteria nearly 30 years ago
35,Decisions about whether to use CRISPR to treat people who are already sick 
36,Genetic Editing of Embryos Is Deeply Disturbing
37,We’re Not God
38,t’s not uncommon to see people design or redesign their homes or offices 
39,he removed from the embryos a gene that may be a factor in HIV 
40,His actions have drawn wide condemnation
41,Twila Brase president president and co-founder of the Minnesota-based 
42,What we’re really talking about here is the possibility of making babies 
43,We don’t know how this will go
44,Brase added that people and news outlets are trying to figure out to what extent is this true and how does the scientist actually define 
45,What did he actually do
46,Brase says that protecting oneself means understanding how HIV is caught
47,there will be people and special interest groups that say CRISPR could and should be used more to genetically edit babies 
48,We aren’t God and we don’t know the unintended consequences of messing as it were the DNA of a human
49,It’s really important to look at the future and wonder what it would mean for people who chose not to be edited
50,a pro-life law firm and advocacy group is not pleased with the idea
51,It's an enormous threat
52,This is far too premature
53,used a gene-editing technique known as CRISPR to alter the DNA of two children in a petri dish 
54,the American researchers killed theirs
55,The prospect of genetically eliminating crippling diseases is certainly appealing
56,there is a difference between genetic engineering and the extremely promising field of gene therapy
57,Playing with humanity's genetic code could open a Pandora's box
58,Scientists will eventually be able to alter DNA not just to protect against disease but also to create genetically enhanced human beings
59,Only the wealthy would be able to afford made-to-order babies
60,This means the privileged few would be able to eliminate imperfections and improve the talent
61,locking in their privilege for generations
62,Those at the bottom would not
63,This could be a death blow to the American Dream
64,the idea that anyone who is willing to work hard in this country can rise up the economic ladder
65,genetic engineering could actually eliminate opportunities for those at the bottom
66,one path to higher education for those at the bottom is scholarships for athletic or artistic talents
67,those scholarships will disappear for the unenhanced poor
68,with them the opportunities to improve their economic prospects in life
69,over time society will begin develop an intolerance for imperfection
70,if your children have an illness because you didn't genetically eliminate it
71,if they can't keep up because of their unenhanced cognitive abilities
72,makes them an unjust burden on the rest of us
73,we are separated into the enhanced and unenhanced
74,respect for the dignity of every human life will be diminished
75,If we don't make it in life because we are unenhanced
76,we don't get the credit
77,It is one thing to hit seventy home runs as the result of disciplined training and effort
78,Then there is the threat to women's equality
79,If genetic engineering can offer the promise of eliminating disease
80,it will also allow parents to choose the sex of their child
81,where the one-child policy led to mass infanticide of girls
82,It will also lead to an explosion in the number of discarded children
83,there are multiple fetuses which are created but never used
84, We should not be playing God
85,enetic research holds the promise to prevent cure and even eliminate disease
86,we have crossed a moral line from which there may be no return
87,What is it and should we worry
88, the excitement surrounding gene editing
89,is its potential to save people who would otherwise likely inherit a terminal or debilitating illness
90,Genetic disorders ranging from the inconvenient to the fatal can be passed down through the generations
91,a relatively new scientific breakthrough
92,the question of gene editing is very much up in the air
93,he debate rages on over how much science should influence man’s physical future
94,if such extraordinary advances will remain out of the reach of the average
95,a Chinese scientist announced he had conducted a human trial 
96,embryos before the process was categorically proven to be safe
97,One key moral element concerns the passing down of side-effects after gene editing is carried out on a foetus or child – the treatment can affect their later parenting options
98,her concerns the first genetically edited babies
99,Genetically-Edited Babies Renews Ethics Concerns
